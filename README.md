# **GDSC ML TASK** 

This repository contains two machine learning projects as part of the **Google Developer Student Club (GDSC) AI/ML Round 2**. The tasks focus on **deep learning (CIFAR-10 classification)** and **retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) using LangChain**.

## **Task A: CIFAR-10 Image Classification**  
A deep learning model trained on the CIFAR-10 dataset using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs).  

### **Features:**  
--> Data preprocessing & augmentation  
--> Model architecture using CNNs  
--> Training with hyperparameter tuning  
--> Performance evaluation & visualization  
--> (Bonus) Transfer Learning implementation  

ðŸ”¹ **Files:**  
- `CIFAR-10.ipynb`: Standard CIFAR-10 training script  
- `CIFAR-10 (with brownies).ipynb`: Extended version with additional optimizations

## **Task B: AI Agent with RAG & Function Calling**  
An AI assistant using **LangChain**, integrating **retrieval-augmented generation (RAG)** and **function calling** for answering questions and performing basic arithmetic.  

### **Features:**  
--> File-based retrieval system  
--> Basic arithmetic computation using function calling  
--> (Bonus) Summarization & web search integration  

ðŸ”¹ **Files:**  
- `AI AGENT (with brownies).ipynb`: Main AI agent implementation
